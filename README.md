# gettingAndCleaningData_projAssignment1
Scripts required to get and clean data as suggested in the Project Assignment in Coursera.com

Presumption:
I suppose a person who will want to use the uploaded scripts would be aware of the project assignment.
And so would know how to look for and download the original data sets (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

Here is a quick glance at the Assignment tasks:
1. You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

As for step 1, I have created a script and uploaded the same to my repo:

Also I have chosen to perform the required activities from Step 2 till 5 in the run_analysis.R script. Request you to please look at the script file to assess the same.
